6. usermod -l login-name old-name

	rwx - allrights, 
    	--- - no rights, 
    	--x - only execute(no modify or read),
    	-w- - only write,
    	r-- - only read
    	--s - the SUID or SGID bit is set, the first is displayed in the field for the owner, the second for the group;
    	--t - sticky-bit is set, which means users cannot delete this file.
	So if th file is owned by root and the SUID bit is turned on, the program will run as root. 
	Even if you execute it as a regular user. 
	The same thing applies to the GUID bit
